We go through creating 2 different kinds of NFTs.

    An IPFS Hosted NFT
    An SVG NFT (Hosted 100% on-chain)

Getting Started
Requirements

    git
        You'll know you did it right if you can run git --version and you see a response like git version x.x.x
    foundry
        You'll know you did it right if you can run forge --version and you see a response like forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)

Quickstart

git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-nft-cu
cd foundry-nft-cu
forge install
forge build

Optional Gitpod

If you can't or don't want to run and install locally, you can work with this repo in Gitpod. If you do this, you can skip the clone this repo part.

Open in Gitpod
Usage
Start a local node

make anvil

Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

make deploy

Deploy - Other Network

See below
Testing

We talk about 4 test tiers in the video.

    Unit
    Integration
    Forked
    Staging

This repo we cover #1 and #3.

forge test

or

forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL

Test Coverage

forge coverage

Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

    Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your SEPOLIA_RPC_URL and PRIVATE_KEY as environment variables. You can add them to a .env file, similar to what you see in .env.example.

    PRIVATE_KEY: The private key of your account (like from metamask). NOTE: FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
        You can learn how to export it here.
    SEPOLIA_RPC_URL: This is url of the goerli testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from Alchemy

Optionally, add your ETHERSCAN_API_KEY if you want to verify your contract on Etherscan.

    Get testnet ETH

Head over to faucets.chain.link and get some tesnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

    Deploy (IPFS NFT)

make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"

    Deploy (SVG NFT)

make deploySvg ARGS="--network sepolia"

Scripts

After deploy to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.

Using cast deployed locally example:

cast send <RAFFLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "enterRaffle()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL

or, to create a ChainlinkVRF Subscription:

make createSubscription ARGS="--network sepolia"

Base64

To get the base64 of an image, you can use the following command:

echo "data:image/svg+xml;base64,$(base64 -i ./images/dynamicNft/happy.svg)"

Then, you can get the base64 encoding of the json object by placing the imageURI into happy_image_uri.json then running:

echo "data:application/json;base64,$(base64 -i ./images/dynamicNft/happy_image_uri.json)"

Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

forge snapshot

And you'll see and output file called .gas-snapshot
Formatting

To run code formatting:

forge fmt
